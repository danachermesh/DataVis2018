# HW3 

**Overview:** In this homework, we exercise building a full visualization pipeline that requires data to be served
dynamically based on user interactions on the front-end. Your task is to reproduce the visualization with a
user interface that allows users to enter a zip code, and then show the distribution of cuisine within that zip
code. The data source is the same as in the previous homework:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hvo/datasets/master/nyc_restaurants_by_cuisine.json
