## Task 1: 
_Please identify a plot or visualization that are available through online media, or in printed materials, where: 
1. It makes use of any of the data sets available on NYC Open Data, and 
2. You believe that the visualization can be improved based on two or more of the plotting principles that we have discussed in class (i.e. the 4 principles for improving the vision, and the 5 principles for improving the understanding)._

The plot had been chosen for this task is Demolishment Permits issuance from years 2008-2012.
- The plot retrieved from: https://www.propertyshark.com/Real-Estate-Reports/2013/02/26/nyc-demolition-permits-slowly-rising-new-building-permits-level/ 
- The plot makes use of DOB permit issuance dataset, available through [NYC open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a/data). For reproducing the plot, I filtered the data to include 2008-2012 DM permits only.

### Plot Critique: 
1.	Firstly, it is not obvious whether the data is per day (and then the continuous line makes sense) or is it no. of demolition permits for each year (and then a bar chart would be more appropriate). I assume the latter is the case, which means the choice of a continuous line is not the best choice.
2.	Second, the legend is on the right side + the title above all (with no y axis lines continuing) looks unproportioned / wrong. We should make the y axis lines more light-weighted and continue them for the whole width of the plot, making sure the legend and title are well positioned.
3.	The x axis ticks should be above the year and not between every pair of years. Also, x label and y label are missing.
